# Sea-Level-Predictor
You will analyze a dataset of the global average sea level change since 1880 and  predict the sea level change through year 2050. 
# What I learned
- Used Matplot Lib to create a scatter plot showing the change in Sea Level with respect to time
- Used linregress functon to get the slope and y-intercept to find line of best fit
